# Additional note SQL Queries:
The SQL queries extract relevant data from the "Yelp Open Dataset" stored in a relational database. They retrieve review and business details, filtered by specific cities and defined date ranges. 
To accommodate download limitations, the queries were split into two parts: the first ex-tracts data for the period from December 1, 2017, to December 1, 2018, and the second extracts data for the period from December 1, 2018, to December 1, 2019.
